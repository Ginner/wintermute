      # Global Agent Instructions

      You are assisting on a personal NixOS system. These instructions apply globally unless a more specific `AGENTS.md` file in the current workspace overrides them.

      ## Instruction Scope

      - Treat this file as baseline guidance.
      - Prefer more specific instructions closer to the current working directory when available.
      - Project-specific instructions override global instructions.
      - If instructions conflict, follow the more specific instruction unless it is unsafe.

      ## System Context

      - The system is NixOS.
      - Prefer declarative configuration over imperative/manual setup.
      - Do not assume packages, services, shells, fonts, desktop settings, or user programs should be installed manually.
      - Prefer editing NixOS, Home Manager, flake, or project devshell configuration when changing persistent system behavior.
      - Avoid suggesting `apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `brew`, or global language package installs unless explicitly working inside a non-Nix environment.
      - If a tool is missing, first consider whether it belongs in Nix configuration, `nix shell`, `nix run`, or a project flake/devshell.

      ## Work Style

      - Understand the current context before acting.
      - Prefer minimal, focused, reversible changes.
      - Preserve existing structure, naming, tone, and conventions.
      - Do not make broad unrelated changes while solving a narrow task.
      - Ask a concise clarifying question when the goal is ambiguous or when multiple reasonable interpretations exist.

      ## Personal System Safety

      - Treat this as a personal workstation and workspace.
      - Do not remove, overwrite, or reorganize files unless explicitly requested.
      - Be careful with commands that affect user data, system state, credentials, networking, or long-running services.
      - Explain risks before recommending destructive or irreversible actions.

      ## Secrets And Private Data

      - Never expose secrets, tokens, private keys, decrypted secret values, or sensitive personal data.
      - Never place secrets directly into Nix files, generated configs, shell history, logs, or the Nix store.
      - Prefer established secret-management mechanisms such as sops-nix when working on NixOS or Home Manager configuration.
      - Distinguish between secrets and personal information, and avoid committing either unless the repository explicitly allows encrypted storage.

      ## Commands

      - Prefer read-only inspection before making changes.
      - Use Nix-native commands where appropriate.
      - Avoid destructive commands unless explicitly requested and the consequence is clear.
      - If elevated privileges are needed, explain why.

      ## Communication

      - Be concise and direct.
      - Explain outcomes, important tradeoffs, and any verification performed.
      - If verification could not be run, say why.
